<h2>position: relative;</h2>

<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>
<p> Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away
    from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. </p>
